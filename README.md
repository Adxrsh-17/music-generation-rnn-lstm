üé∂ Music Generation with LSTM
This repository features a machine learning project that generates music using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Trained on a dataset of classical MIDI files, the model learns musical patterns and structures to compose original pieces.

üöÄ Project Overview
The core objective of this project is to develop a neural network model, powered by LSTMs, capable of generating unique musical compositions. By learning temporal relationships within sequences of musical notes, the LSTM model produces new compositions that mirror the stylistic patterns found in the training data.

‚ú® Key Features
MIDI File Parsing: Utilizes the music21 library to efficiently parse MIDI files, extracting individual notes and chords.

LSTM-Based Model: Built with LSTM layers, making it exceptionally well-suited for intricate sequence prediction tasks like music generation.

Dynamic Music Generation: Post-training, the model can generate fresh melodies based on an initial sequence of notes.

Customizable Dataset: Offers the flexibility for users to train the model on their own MIDI files, enabling the creation of diverse musical styles.

üìñ Usage
Dataset Preparation
Before training, organize your MIDI files in the designated directory. The project includes scripts to streamline the organization and accessibility of your dataset for seamless training.

Model Training
Once your dataset is ready, initiate the training process. The LSTM model learns the relationships between musical notes by processing sequences of notes, ultimately predicting subsequent notes. Training spans multiple epochs to minimize prediction errors.

Music Generation
After successful training, the model is ready to compose! Provide a seed sequence (a few initial notes), and the model will predict the following notes, crafting a melody that reflects its learned patterns. The generated music can then be saved as a MIDI file for easy playback.

üß† Model Architecture
The model's foundation is an LSTM architecture, perfect for sequence prediction in time-series analysis and music generation. Key architectural components include:

LSTM Layers: The backbone of the model, designed to capture intricate temporal dependencies within music sequences.

Dropout Layers: Essential for mitigating overfitting during training by randomly deactivating a fraction of input units.

Dense Layer: The final output layer, featuring a softmax activation function to generate probabilities for each possible note in the sequence.

The model is optimized using the Adamax optimizer, known for its efficiency in training deep learning models.

üóÉÔ∏è Dataset
This model is primarily trained on a dataset of classical music in MIDI format. Each MIDI file represents a distinct musical piece. These files are meticulously processed to extract notes and chords, which then serve as training data for the LSTM model.

Remember, you have the option to train the model on your own MIDI files to explore various musical styles!

üì¶ Dependencies
The project relies on the following essential Python libraries:

music21: A powerful Python toolkit for computer-assisted musicology, crucial for parsing and manipulating MIDI files.

tensorflow: An open-source machine learning library used for building and training the LSTM model.

numpy: The fundamental package for numerical computing in Python.
